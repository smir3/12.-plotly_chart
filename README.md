# Belly Button Bacteria

## Purpose
Improbable Beef, a food start-up, is searching for the bacterial species which produces the perfect tasting synthetic meat. They hypothesize that this bacteria can be found within the navel of the human body. To test this hypothesis, the navels of people across the country have been sampled to identify bacterial species that colonize the belly button. Different parts of the human body harbour different species of bacteria, and between individuals, bacteria may even vary within the same location. 

## Task
The purpose of this analysis is to build an online dashboard that research participants and researchers can access. Each person has been assigned an ID number to ensure their identity remains anonymous. Those who participate in the study should be able to visit the website, select their ID number, and see which bacterial species live in their navels. The website will display a panel containing demographic information as well as visually display the Top 10 bacterial species in their belly button. This way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the study participants will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
